# Speed Detector

## Introduction
The Speed Detector is a JavaScript program that takes the speed of a car as input and determines if the car is within the speed limit or if the driver should incur demerit points. It follows a specific set of rules to calculate the demerit points based on the speed of the car. The program is designed to provide feedback to the driver, indicating whether their speed is acceptable, the number of demerit points, and if their license is suspended.
